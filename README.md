# Ta-da-recipe-dataset


Here is the Ta-da recipe dataset. We work on building a Chinese recipe dataset for recipe recommendation, Q&A and other algorithm research. Our data is sourced from several Chinese recipe sharing social networking sites and contains recipe information, ingredient information, interaction information, taste information, etc. In terms of data volume, we crawled 12,142 recipes uploaded from 2017 to 2021, containing 3,412 ingredients, and with 224,310 interactions from 16,679 users.

To ensure the quality of the dataset, the team cleaned and pre-processed the initial data, and built the precipitated knowledge into a knowledge graph and applied it to the practical aspects. The details of the work will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper by the team members.

We present here a demo of the dataset.

Due to the unpublished paper and the confidentiality of the project, we have only published a part of the data as a formal presentation. We have not yet published the user review data in the dataset. The complete dataset and the construction method will be fully disclosed after the publication of the paper.
